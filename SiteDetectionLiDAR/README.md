# Automatic archaeological site detection in LiDAR imagery

These Jupyter Notebooks can run on Google Colab (https://colab.google.com) and demonstrate the use of Open AI GPT4 and Google Gemini foundation models for the automated detection of archaeological sites.

The test data used here is a set of hillforts from England in a ZIP file, but you can use your own data, too. Simply replace the ZIP file URL in the Notebook with the URL of your own ZIP file (e.g. stored in Google Drive or the like).
